## About

Artisant is a comprehensive full-stack web application created during a hackathon to showcase how quickly a modern, production-ready platform can be built. It demonstrates a clean separation between backend services and frontend user experience, includes automated testing for reliability, and is designed for seamless deployment to cloud platforms.

The application is intended as a hub for artisans and creative professionals: it allows them to create and manage portfolios, display their work, interact with potential clients, and collaborate with other creators. The project also serves as a reference for developers interested in learning best practices in full-stack development, continuous integration, and rapid prototyping.

---

## Features

- **Modern Frontend UI** – A responsive and accessible user interface designed to showcase artisan content effectively.  
- **Robust Backend API** – Secure and scalable APIs to handle data storage, user management, and business logic.  
- **Authentication & Profiles** – Supports user accounts, profiles, and secure login (implementation ready).  
- **Automated Testing** – Integrated tests for core modules to ensure code quality and stability.  
- **Modular Architecture** – Clearly separated backend and frontend directories for easier maintenance.  
- **Extensibility** – Built with a clean architecture so new features can be added rapidly without breaking existing ones.

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technologies Used |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Backend** | Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI – adjust as per actual code) for API endpoints, data handling and business logic |
| **Frontend** | React or Next.js for a modern, component-based UI |
| **Database** | (e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) for persistent storage |
| **Testing** | Python `unittest` / `pytest` for backend; React Testing Library/Jest for frontend |
| **Styling** | CSS-in-JS / Tailwind CSS / Styled Components for consistent design |

This stack was chosen for its balance between speed of development and production readiness, allowing small teams to build and ship features quickly.

## Project Structure
Got it — you want to keep the same structure but make the sections richer and more descriptive, while dropping the demo/deployment link.
Here’s an expanded version of your README with more “theory” and context, but no live-demo links:

This structure keeps the backend and frontend isolated for clarity, while the tests directory ensures code quality across both.

---

## Requirements

- **Python** ≥ 3.x (for backend)  
- **Node.js** ≥ 16.x and npm/yarn (for frontend)  
- **Git** for version control  
- (Optional) A local database engine if not using SQLite  

Check the respective `requirements.txt` and `package.json` files for exact dependency versions.

---

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and set up each part separately:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinitjain2005/Hackathon.git
cd Hackathon

Backend setup

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py  # or the main backend file

Frontend setup

cd ../frontend
npm install   # or yarn install
npm run dev   # or yarn dev

Visit http://localhost:3000 (or the configured port) in your browser to see the frontend.


---

Running Tests

Run backend tests:

pytest tests/

Run frontend tests (if configured):

npm test

All tests should pass before committing or deploying new features.
