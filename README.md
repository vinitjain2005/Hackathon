# Artisant

## About  

Artisant is a full-stack web application built as part of a hackathon to demonstrate how quickly a real-world platform can be designed, implemented, and prepared for deployment. The project combines a modern frontend with a scalable backend and integrates automated testing to ensure reliability.  

During development we:  

- Designed the information architecture and user experience for artisans to showcase portfolios and manage projects.  
- Implemented a RESTful API to handle user data, content, and authentication securely.  
- Created a responsive frontend interface to display artisan profiles, portfolios, and allow interactions.  
- Integrated automated tests to validate core functionality and prevent regressions.  
- Followed best practices for clean code, modular architecture, and version control to make the codebase easy to maintain and extend.  

This project can serve both as a functional prototype for a real service and as a learning resource for developers interested in full-stack development, CI/CD, and rapid prototyping.

## Tech Stack  

| Component | Technologies Used |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Backend** | Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI – adjust to actual code), RESTful API, data storage layer (SQLite/PostgreSQL) |
| **Frontend** | React or Next.js with modular components and routing |
| **Styling** | CSS/Tailwind CSS for responsive, consistent UI |
